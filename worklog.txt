I am starting to work through Ray Tracing in One Weekend.

RITOW: 1. Overview
Ray tracing: a path tracer.
Final Outcome: a ray tracer that produces some great images.
Why C++: fast, portable, and most production movie and video game renderers are written in C++.


RITOW: 2.1 The PPM Image Format
Way to see an image: write it to a file.
For plain text ppm file, some Notes in C++:
First, pixels: write from left to right
Second, rows: write from top to bottom
Third, each of components range: high dynamic


RITOW: 2.2 Creating an Image File
We need to redirect it to an image file. (because the file is written to the program output) -- Use > (which is a redirection operator)
For Mac/Linux: build/inOneWeekend > image.ppm
For Windows: build\Release\inOneWeekend.exe > image.ppm
On Mac, using ToyViewer to open the output file (or Google "ppm viewer")


RITOW: 2.3 Adding a Progress Indicator
Advantages: track the progress of a long render; identify a run that's stalled out due to an infinite loop or other problem.
image -- std::cout
error -- std::cerr


RITOW: 3. The vec3 Class
Almost all graphics programs -- some classes for storing geometric vectors and colors.
Vectors are 4D: 3D+a homogeneous coordinate for geometry & RGB+an alpha transparency channels for colors.
We use the same class vec3 for colors, locations, directions, offsets, etc.
Two aliases for vec3: point2 and color.
