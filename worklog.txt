I am starting to work through Ray Tracing in One Weekend.


RTIOW: 1. Overview
Ray tracing: a path tracer.
Final Outcome: a ray tracer that produces some great images.
Why C++: fast, portable, and most production movie and video game renderers are written in C++.


RTIOW: 2.1 The PPM Image Format
Way to see an image: write it to a file.
For plain text ppm file, some Notes in C++:
First, pixels: write from left to right
Second, rows: write from top to bottom
Third, each of components range: high dynamic
